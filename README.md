# TODO.TXT - WPF

This is an implementation of [todo.txt][todo.txt] using the .NET Framework. This is a rework of Ben Hughes implementation of the same. You can find the original work [here][todotxt.net].

This implementation conforms to the [todo.txt format specfication][todo.txt.spec] defined by Gina Trapani.

## Purpose
This started off as re-write of [todotxt.net][todotxt.net] purely from a learning point-of-view. I was trying to learn Reactive extension and Reactive UI. This slowly lead to a full-fledged implementation. I still have a lot to learn and this is in no way a perfect implementation. Please feel free to improve on it anyway you like. I have tried to maintain all the original goals set up by Ben Hughes and also retained the look and feel of the UI, with just a little bit of polish catering to my personal taste.

If you have found the app useful, please make a donation towards any of the below charities.
